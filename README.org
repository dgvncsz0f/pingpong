* Ping Pong

  Ping Pong is a library for quickly creating line-based interactive programs.

** Motivation
   
   This has been created to provide a mechanism to test programs using =expect=. We are using it to create phony interfaces that although do nothing, provide the same interface as the real device. This allows us to test these applications easily.

   Besides, special care has been taken to be able to use different protocols. Currently there is a /TTY/ and /SSH/ backends. The later makes use of =twisted=, so it should be fairly simple to add other protocols.

** Dependencies

*** Main library

    * python          [>= 2.6]
    * twisted
    * twisted-conch

*** Testing

    * nose
    * mock

** Example

   Examples are available in =src/conductor/samples=.

** Testing

   #+begin_example
     $ make tests
   #+end_example
